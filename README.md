This repository contains implementations of various searching algorithms written in assembly language. These algorithms are designed to efficiently search for elements in arrays and demonstrate the principles of algorithmic searching in low-level programming.
Algorithms Included
1- Linear Search
Description: Implements the linear search algorithm to find a target element in an array.
2- Binary Search
Description: Implements the binary search algorithm to find a target element in a sorted array.
